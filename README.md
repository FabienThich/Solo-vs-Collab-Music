# Analysis of Spotify Musical Attributes in Solo vs Collaborative Tracks

## Description
This project analyzes various musical attributes of tracks on Spotify to determine how they differ between solo and collaborative tracks. The attributes analyzed include:

- Popularity
- Duration (ms)
- Explicitly
- Danceability
- Energy
- Key
- Loudness
- Mode
- Speechiness
- Acoustics
- Instrumentals
- Liveness
- Valence
- Tempo
- Time Signature
- Track_genre

The goal is to explore whether collaborations typically result in higher danceability, energy levels, and other musical characteristics than solo tracks. The analysis includes data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), hypothesis testing, and visualization to provide insights into these differences.

## Steps Involved
1. **Data Cleaning**: Removing duplicates, handling missing values, and ensuring correct data types.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Calculating summary statistics and creating visualizations to explore the data.
3. **Data Processing**: Creating new columns and normalizing/standardizing data if necessary.
4. **Analysis**: Comparing descriptive statistics and creating visualizations to gain insights.
5. **Hypothesis Testing**: Performing T-tests for numerical attributes and Chi-square tests for categorical attributes to determine if there are significant differences between solo and collaborative tracks.
